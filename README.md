# terrarium
An attempt to do a free and open source Terraria clone game, possibly with some new features. 

It is still in the first stages, so its pretty dumb.

It's coded in C++, using Box2D and either Allegro 5.0, SDL 2.0 or SDL 1.2. The code 
is in a Eclipse CDT project. Previously CodeLite and QtCreator were used, so there are old 
branches using their project structure (but again, the code is mostly oudated).

See [BUILDING.md](https://gitlab.com/hydren/terrarium/blob/master/BUILDING.md) for information about building the code.
